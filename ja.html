        <h1>Fairy tales</h1>

        <p>A fairy tale, fairytale, wonder tale, magic tale, or Märchen is an instance of a folklore genre that takes
            the form of a short story. Such stories typically feature entities such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies,
            giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually
            magic or enchantments. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; all
            these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other
            folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and
            explicit moral tales, including beast fables.</p>

        <p>In less technical contexts, the term is also used to describe something blessed with unusual happiness, as in
            "fairy-tale ending" (a happy ending) or "fairy-tale romance". Colloquially, the term "fairy tale" or "fairy
            story" can also mean any far-fetched story or tall tale; it is used especially of any story that not only is
            not true, but could not possibly be true. Legends are perceived[by whom?] as real; fairy tales may merge
            into legends, where the narrative is perceived both by teller and hearers as being grounded in historical
            truth. However, unlike legends and epics, fairy tales usually do not contain more than superficial
            references to religion and to actual places, people, and events; they take place "once upon a time" rather
            than in actual times.</p>

        <p>Fairy tales occur both in oral and in literary form; the name "fairy tale" ("conte de fées" in French) was
            first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy in the late 17th century. Many of today's fairy tales have evolved
            from centuries-old stories that have appeared, with variations, in multiple cultures around the world. The
            history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace because only the literary forms can survive.
            Still, according to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, such stories may date back thousands
            of years, some to the Bronze Age more than 6,500 years ago. Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales,
            are still written today.</p>

        <p>Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. The Aarne-Thompson classification system and the
            morphological analysis of Vladimir Propp are among the most notable. Other folklorists have interpreted the
            tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.</p>
